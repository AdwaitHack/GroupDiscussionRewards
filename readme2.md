# GroupDiscussionRewards

## Project Title
**GroupDiscussionRewards**: A Smart Contract for Rewarding Participants in Group Discussions

## Project Description
**GroupDiscussionRewards** is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that enables the creation and management of group discussions with a reward mechanism. It allows discussion creators to set a reward pool, and participants who contribute to the discussion are eligible to claim a portion of the reward pool based on their participation. The contract ensures that only active discussions can reward participants, and it facilitates an incentive-driven environment for productive conversations.

This contract provides a way for communities or platforms to encourage participation in discussions by rewarding users with Ethereum-based tokens.

## Project Vision
The vision of **GroupDiscussionRewards** is to create a decentralized and incentivized environment where users are rewarded for participating in meaningful discussions. By integrating a reward pool with Ethereum smart contracts, this system aims to empower communities by fostering active participation and valuable contributions. The reward system ensures that discussions are both engaging and productive, promoting a culture of learning and interaction within various platforms.

## Key Features

- **Create Discussions**: The contract allows the owner (creator) to start discussions by specifying a topic and a reward pool in Ether.
- **Participate in Discussions**: Users can participate in active discussions, and their participation is recorded to ensure eligibility for rewards.
- **Reward Distribution**: Participants who engage in discussions can claim their fair share of the reward pool once the discussion ends. Rewards are distributed equally among the participants.
- **Active Discussion Tracking**: Discussions are marked as active or inactive, ensuring that rewards can only be claimed from active discussions.
- **Security & Ownership**: The contract is owned and controlled by a single address, which is responsible for creating discussions and ending them. Only the owner can perform certain actions, such as creating discussions and ending them.
- **Efficient Reward Distribution**: Rewards are divided equally among participants based on the reward pool and the number of participants, ensuring fairness.
